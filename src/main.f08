!> \brief   The Git alias configuration program.
!> \return  This program will return with exit code zero, by default.
!>
!> This program will invoke the configuration of the defined Git alias commands.
!>
!> Due to the naming convention of Git, this program can be integrated into it.
!> Git will treat any applications prefixed with `git-` as associated commands
!> \cite chacon.straub:git:2014.  Doing so with this program is a benefit since
!> one can not only configure all aliases with this tool but also request a
!> summary of the aliases set up by it.
!>
!> The resulting program does not require any command line arguments.  If there
!> should be some, however, they are going to be ignored.
!>
!> The application is going to exit with code zero.  Another behaviour is not
!> configured.  The exit code might vary, however, in case that the call to Git
!> should fail for some reasons.
!>
!> Recommended further readings and references are listed in the following.
